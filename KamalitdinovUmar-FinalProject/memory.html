                <p>The Istanbul final, also known as the Miracle of Istanbul, refers to the 2005 UEFA Champions League final between Liverpool and AC Milan. It is considered one of the greatest comebacks in football history. Liverpool, losing 3-0 at halftime, made a stunning comeback in the second half, scoring three goals in a span of six minutes to make the score 3-3. The match eventually went to penalties, where Liverpool took what was ours, securing our fifth European Cup.</p>

            <div class="mem-moment-desc">
                <p>After a rough start of the 2015-16 campaign, Brendon Rogers is sacked. Liverpool was at the 10th place in the Premier League at that time. But then he came and changed everything. Jürgen Klopp is the new Liverpool manager. The Anfield club confirmed the appointment of the former Borussia Dortmund coach after he signed an initial three-year contract.</p>

                <p>May 7 marks a year to the day since Liverpool pulled off the impossible, the unthinkable. Trailing 3-0 after a humbling semi-final first-leg defeat at the Camp Nou, Liverpool produced one of football's greatest comebacks, beating Barcelona 4-0 to reach the Champions League final for the second successive season.</p>

                <p>Liverpool Football Club are Premier League champions. The Reds have clinched the crown for 2019-20 after Wednesday’s 4-0 victory over Crystal Palace at Anfield left Manchester City needing a win against Chelsea this evening. The 2-1 defeat for City at Stamford Bridge ensures Jürgen Klopp’s side cannot mathematically be caught in the table. It means Liverpool have secured the club’s 19th league title, ending a 30-year wait following their previous success in 1990.</p>
